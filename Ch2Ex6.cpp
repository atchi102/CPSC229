/*Buoyancy is the ability of an object to float.
Archimedesâ€™ Principle states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the
fluid that is displaced by the submerged object.
The buoyant force can be computed by Fb = V * g
where Fb is the buoyant force, V is the volume of the submerged object,
and g is the specific weight of the fluid.
If Fb is greater than or equal to the weight of the object, then it will float, otherwise it will sink.
Write a program that inputs the weight (in pounds) and radius (in feet) of a sphere
and outputs whether the sphere will sink or float in water.
Use g = 62.4 lb/ft3 as the specific weight of water.
The volume of a sphere is computed by (4/3)pir^3. */
