/*A liter is 0.264179 gallons.
Write a program that will read in the number of liters of gasoline
consumed by the userâ€™s car and the number of miles traveled by the car
and will then output the number of miles per gallon the car delivered.
Your program should allow the user to repeat this calculation as often as the user wishes.
Define a function to compute the number of miles per gallon.
Your program should use a globally defined constant for the number of liters per gallon. */
